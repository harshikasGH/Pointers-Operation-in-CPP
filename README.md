# Pointer Operations in C++  

---

## Aim  
To study and implement pointer operations in C++ and understand the difference between **call by value** and **call by reference** parameter-passing methods.  

## Theory  

In C++, the way we pass parameters to functions determines whether changes inside the function affect the original variables.  

### Call by Value  
- **Definition:** A copy of the actual parameter is passed to the function.  
- **Effect:** Changes happen only on the copy → originals remain unchanged.  
- **Working:** Function operates in its own scope and does not affect caller variables.  

### 🔗 Call by Reference  
- **Definition:** The address or reference of actual parameters is passed, allowing direct modification of originals.  
- **Effect:** Changes done inside the function reflect in the caller variables.  
- **Working:** Function receives pointers (or references) → dereferences them to access and modify actual memory.

## Comparison Table  

| Feature                 | Call by Value           | Call by Reference       |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Data Passed**             | Copy of value              | Address / reference         |
| **Changes affect original** | No                      | Yes                      |
| **Memory Use**              | Extra copy made            | No extra copy               |
| **Safety**                  | Safer (no side effects)    | Can change caller data      |
| **Typical Use Case**        | Read-only operations       | In-place modifications      |

## Algorithms  

### Employee Salary Increment Check  

1. **Start**  
2. Input details:  
   - `yearsCompleted` → Number of years employee has worked  
   - `hasResearchProjects` → Worked on research projects (Yes/No)  
   - `hasNewProjectPipeline` → New research project in pipeline (Yes/No)  
   - `profitGenerated` → Profit generated in Rs  
   - `currentSalary` → Current salary of employee  
3. Call function `checkIncrement()` by passing **addresses** of above values.  
4. Inside function:  
   - Initialize `conditionsMet = 0`  
   - If `yearsCompleted >= 1`, increment `conditionsMet`.  
   - If `hasResearchProjects == true`, increment `conditionsMet`.  
   - If `hasNewProjectPipeline == true`, increment `conditionsMet`.  
   - If `profitGenerated > 100000`, increment `conditionsMet`.  
5. If `conditionsMet >= 3`:  
   - Increase salary by **20%**  
   - Print `"Eligible for increment"` and new salary  
6. Else:  
   - Print `"Not eligible for increment"` and unchanged salary  
7. **End**

### Reverse a String using Pointers  

1. **Start**  
2. Input a string `str1`.  
3. Find length of string → `n = str1.length()`.  
4. Store base address of string in a pointer: `ptr = &str1[0]`.  
5. Display message `"Reversed String"`.  
6. Loop from `i = n - 1` to `0`:  
   - Print `*(ptr + i)`  
7. After loop ends, reversed string is displayed.  
8. **End**

## Conclusion  

This experiment demonstrates the difference between parameter-passing methods in C++.  

- **Call by Value** → Works on copies, originals remain safe.  
- 🔗 **Call by Reference** → Works directly on real data, originals are modified.  
- Key Insight:  
  - Use **Call by Value** for safety (read-only operations).  
  - Use **Call by Reference** for in-place updates and efficiency.
